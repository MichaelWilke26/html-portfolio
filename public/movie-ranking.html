<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>

<h2>My Favourite Movies and Why</h2>

<hr />

<h3>August Rush</h3>
<P>The music and story in this movie is absolutely mesmerising. Highly recommend.</P>

<h3>The Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p>I'm a bit of a Potterhead so I may be biased, but these movies are absolutely magical (haha) and always take me away with these fantastical stories.</p>

<h3>Man from U.N.C.L.E</h3>
<p>An absolute hilarious action-comedy that is well balanced and always keeps me on the eadge of my seat.</p>
